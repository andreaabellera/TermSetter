        <h3>What is TermSetter?</h3>
        <p>TermSetter is an Android Application that you can use as an alternative to U of M Aurora. You can use TermSetter to log in, explore offered courses, and register for courses you want. It also provides a better GUI as well.<br><br>Termsetter is intended to be used primarily by university students, motivated by the necessity to improve upon the current Aurora system used for class enrollment. Basic features provided include an interface allowing student registration and login, as well as a student information hub. This hub will allow students to both manage account information and display academic progress, such as course history, final grades, and tuition fees.<br><br>Termsetter will introduce two unique features. A section dedicated to course enrollment will allow exploration and self-enrollment in currently offered classes. Termsetter explores and self-enrolls currently offered classes. The offered classes view first displays all categories of classes. When a category is chosen, a list of classes under that category appears. Classes will include the class name, section, instructor, class time, and cost. The student is able to enroll in a class if it does not have time conflicts with other classes and if they have met the prerequisites for the classes. Otherwise, there will be a visual signifier indicating that they cannot take these classes.<br><br>The class timetable displays the classes that a student is currently enrolled in like a day or week view. The day view sorts the classes from the earliest to the latest and displays them as a list. The week view will display the classes under each day side by side. The course tree displays a graphical view of the core classes in the student’s program. Branches will indicate what classes are required by others as prerequisites. The student’s graduation progress is visually signified by moving through the course tree and is noted by the remaining number of credits for core classes and electives.<br><br>Prior to release, early iterations of the Termsetter will use simulated data to represent students, courses, and administrative entities. These will be used to perform early unit tests, prior to the implementation of various database structures. Later, these structures will store student-defined data, which are to be included in the final release of the project.<br><br>Termsetter will present a variety of improvements to the currently used Aurora system by specifically addressing usability issues brought to light by users. While Termsetter provides the same functionality for class enrollment, its unique features aim to improve ease of use, locatability of items, and quicker completion of tasks. The intended design direction will combine lookup and enrollment in one feature, providing a more simplified workflow in contrast to Aurora. The addition of a course tree will assist in the visualization of degree completion.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="column text">
        <p><strong>What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?</strong></p><p><strong>Kevin</strong>: Setting up HSQLDB took us the most time. Making a presentation video took the least time (and surprisingly my voice sounds very different from I hear)</p><p><strong>Andrea</strong>: Working with Enrollment took me by surprise. I thought it would be one of the shorter ones, assigning it an estimate of 2 days. It seems as simple enough as adding one SQL statement. I did not expect the depth of integration it will require: conflict logics, class limits, schema restructuring, dynamically generating sections, and passing all course and section information back and forth through seams. It ended up being the longest feature to implement - counting 10 days!</p><p><strong>What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?</strong></p><p><strong>Eriq</strong>: Two people looking up things on Stackoverflow is better than one! Honestly, working in a group of talented programmers and designers put me at ease. Trusting people you don't know is very hard and I feel that I have an entry level understanding of the development cycle and how a team must work together to make the vision statement a reality. In the future, I plan to communicate with my team more and not ghost them entirely. It took a lot of communication and annoying my teammates with dumb questions to learn the many different ways you can do something. Everyday we relied on each others strengths to move us forward.</p><p><strong>Can you draw any conclusions from what you've done?</strong></p><p><strong>Mika</strong>: Android Studio is the Tim Hortons of software consistency</p><p><strong>Andrea</strong>: Diving headfirst to Android Studio(with its mediocre documentation) and learning the strings from scratch is not an easy feat. Our team took great risks implementing functionalities our way and meddling with unfamiliar libraries. Next time, we should remember that a sample project exists and that we should copy its existing patterns</p>
