# TermSetter - Branching Strategy

For this project, the team will be using a strategy that is a hybrid between GitHub flow and Git flow, since it is best suited to our needs. 

There will be a **shadow-master** branch that as the name suggests will shadow the master branch and will serve as a developer branch of sorts. Any features or bugs that need to be worked on will have a separate branch for it, and everything will be merged to shadow-master initially. Shadow-master will be reviewed, then finally merged into master before the due date of each iteration, ensuring that the master branch is always production-ready. This will allow team members to work separately and collaboratively on different features at the same time. 

Pull requests can be made to review code, discuss proposed changes and safely make adjustments at the shadow-master level, without making the master branch messy.
