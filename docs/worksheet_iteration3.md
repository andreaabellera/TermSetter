What technical debt has been cleaned up
========================================

Show links to a commit where you paid off technical debt. Write 2-5 sentences
that explain what debt was paid, and what its classification is.
(Group discussion)
Possible options:
- Formal database (or Stub database) implementation?
-  

What technical debt did you leave?
==================================

What one item would you like to fix, and can't? Anything you write will not
be marked negatively. Classify this debt.
(Group discussion)
Possible options:
- ... database related?
- Disabling enrollment into courses with conflicting times
- UI API restrictions

Discuss a Feature or User Story that was cut/re-prioritized
============================================

When did you change the priority of a Feature or User Story? Why was it
re-prioritized? Provide a link to the Feature or User Story. This can be from any
iteration.
(Group discussion)
Possible options:
- Removal of course tree; 
    Reprioritized to final iteration, eventually removed
- Removal of degree progression 
    Reprioritized to final iteration, eventually removed

Acceptance test/end-to-end
==========================

Write a discussion about an end-to-end test that you wrote. What did you test,
how did you set up the test so it was not flaky? Provide a link to that test.
(Testing, @Andrea & ?)

Acceptance test, untestable
===============

What challenges did you face when creating acceptance tests? What was difficult
or impossible to test?
(Testing, Andrea & ?)

Velocity/teamwork
=================

Did your estimates get better or worse through the course? Show some
evidence of the estimates/actuals from tasks.
(Group discussion)
Thoughts: Estimates difficult to apply, as features is later iterations were reliant on code established in earlier iterations.
