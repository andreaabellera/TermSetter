# Termsetter A02 Group 6

Termsetter is a mobile application that will allow students to enroll in university courses independently. Termsetter will display student information, current timetables, intuition fees, and graduation progress, providing an environment for students to explore and manage their choice of classes for a term.
 
Termsetter is intended to be used primarily by university students, motivated by the necessity to improve upon the current Aurora system used for class enrollment. Basic features provided include an interface allowing student registration and login, as well as a student information hub. This hub will allow students to both manage account information and display academic progress, such as course history, final grades and tuition fees. 

Termsetter will introduce two unique features. A section dedicated to course enrollment will allow exploration and self-enrollment in currently offered classes. Termsetter explores and self-enrolls currently offered classes. The offered classes view first displays all categories of classes. When a category is chosen, a list of classes under that category appears. Classes will include the class name, section, instructor, class time, and cost. The student is able to enroll in a class if it does not have time conflicts with other classes and if they have met the prerequisites for the classes. Otherwise, there will be a visual signifier indicating that they cannot take these classes.

The class timetable displays the classes that a student is currently enrolled in as a day or week view. The day view sorts the classes from earliest to the latest and displays them as a list. The week view will display the classes under each day side by side. The course tree displays a graphical view of the core classes in the student’s program. Branches will indicate what classes are required by others as prerequisites. The student’s graduation progress is visually signified by moving through the course tree and are noted by the remaining number of credits for core classes and electives.

Prior to release, early iterations of the Termsetter will use simulated data to represent students, courses, and administrative entities. These will be used to perform early unit tests, prior to the implementation of various database structures. Later, these structures will store user defined data, which are to be included in the final release of the project. 

Termsetter will present a variety of improvements to the currently used Aurora system by specifically addressing usability issues brought to light by users. While Termsetter provides the same functionality for class enrollment, its unique features aim to improve ease of use, locatability of items, and quicker completion of tasks. The intended design direction will combine lookup and enrollment in one feature, providing a more simplified workflow in contrast to Aurora. The addition of a course tree will assist in the visualization of degree completion.

The success of the Termsetter will be measured primarily by user preference in comparison to Aurora. A survey will be conducted to determine which system best fulfills usability criteria, with a focus on overall user enjoyment. Additional evaluations of user performance, such as the amount of time needed to complete certain tasks, or number of actions (presses) needed to navigate to certain menus, may also be implemented.
